# jasonetteditor
Online editor (with JSON Schema) for creating new JASONETTE applications.

## What is JASONETTE, though?

Find out more [here](https://github.com/Jasonette/JASONETTE-iOS)!

## Inspiration and Resources

- Building upon the work for [this JSON editor](http://jeremydorn.com/json-editor/), we could adapt the approach to generate proper JSON for JASONETTE!
- Using web technologies, we can convert the SPA into a desktop app that would act as a publishing hub and IDE. [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) might be a good foundation to build upon.

**More to come!**
